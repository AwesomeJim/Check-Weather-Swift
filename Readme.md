## Development Setup ‚öôÔ∏è and Pre-requisite üìù
**The Project uses OpenWeather API :**
1. [OpenWeather API üîë](https://openweathermap.org/current) for Weather Data and.


#### _‚öôÔ∏è Setup Weather Data API_

![openweathermap.png](Screenshots/openweathermap.png) <br/>
This project fetches weather data from the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/current).  
To begin the setup, you'll need to create an account and get a free API key.
1. Create an account at [openweathermap.org](https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys)
2. Go to settings from the profile icon
3. Click on API
4. Click on Create

create a Config file  `Config.xcconfig` and place your API config there 

```swift
#Insert at ~/ Config.xcconfig

// Configuration settings file format documentation can be found at:
// https://help.apple.com/xcode/#/dev745c5c974
//
API_KEY = <Your API Key>
````

## Build and Runtime Requirements
+ Xcode 14.0 or later
+ iOS v13.0 or later
+ macOS v10.10 or later

## Configuring and Running the Project

Configuring the Xcode project requires a few steps in Xcode to get up and running
1) Configure each Mac and iOS device you plan to test, Create or use an existing Apple ID account.
2) Clone or download the App
3) Open the cloned or downloaded project
4) Configure the Team for each target within the project.
    - Open the project in the Project navigator within Xcode and select each of the targets. Set the Team on the General tab to the team associated with your developer account.
5)  Ensure iOS Developer is chosen for the Code Signing Identity setting in the Code Signing section of Target > Build Settings for the following Targets, and change the Build identifier (package id/name)
6) Select the Device you want the App to run on and Click run
